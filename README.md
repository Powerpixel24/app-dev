# **My Favorite** 
## **Series**

### **My favorite series are the following:** 
1. Dark  
<sub>The most fascinating series that I have watched is Dark because it involves a lot of twists and as well as mindbending stories per character. It's about a boy that was lost in a cave and he later found out that ghe time travelled at the past. </sub>
2. Once Upon A Time  
<sub>Once Upon A time is the best fantasy series I have watched. This also involves characters that I really love the most from Disney but their stories are different. For instance, Hansel and Gretel was almost killed not by the witch but by the Evil Queen from Snow White.</sub>
3. His Dark Materials  
<sub>The on going series that really caught my attention. I love how the main protagonist fight all evil alongside with her friend by the use of a magical knife.</sub>
